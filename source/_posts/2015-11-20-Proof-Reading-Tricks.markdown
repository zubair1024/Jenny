Proof reading is done on pieces of writing, to make it as flawless as possible. Whether you are writing a magazine article, a college essay or an email to a client, getting your text free of mistakes is essential. A spell checker helps, but it is far from foolproof. The key of proof reading is to detach yourself and look at your work from unfamiliar perspective. Why should we do this? To tell you the truth (I have been in this situation many times), the brain is a know-it-all that likes to fill in the blanks for us and makes us miss things that are “right there”. I have gathered below a few points that helps me when I have to proof read mine or someone else’s work:

##### Read It (Loud)
If you’re not in a public setting it helps to read the writing out loud. If there is dialog in your writing, give it voices so that you can attach different personalities to your characters. Dramatize it, strive for perfection, and your mind will become more sensitized towards mistakes and typos. This forces you to read each word individually and increases the odds that you’ll find a typo.

##### Review a Hard Copy
If the work is something long and important, you should print it out. Do not be afraid to use a pen to mark mistakes. When you allow yourself to “mark” your own article, you will “accept” the fact that the post is not yet ready, and there is still work to be done.

Don’t Trust the spellchecker or Automated Proofreaders
It helps to use these tools to pick typos, but remember that they do not recognize the contextual setting of the words. Don’t let your trust in them be the reason for your mistakes.

##### Copy and Paste
Always use copy paste, don’t rewrite a word that is already there. Copy-pasting minimizes errors.

##### Work in Cycles
To make sure you catch as many of the typos as possible, do repeated readings: proofread by cycles. In each cycle, check just one particular issue.

##### The Twos and Threes
Check two- and three-letter words. Sometimes they go missing. The culprits include ‘is’, ‘be’, ‘of’, ‘the’,’and’, ‘for’, ‘to’ – you get idea.

##### Deals with Contradictions
This happens to a lot of writers and ever so often in comments as well.

its, it’s
your, you’re
were, we’re
their, they’re

##### Homophones
Homophones are words that sound the same but are spelled differently.

to, too
made vs maid
for vs four
weather vs whether

##### Most Common Mistakes
They don’t sound the same and carry totally different meanings but you see them misused in (too many) places on many occasion.

form, from
lose, loose
then, than
angle, angel
bought, brought

##### Check the Rules
If you listened to your grammar teacher, you might have heard of the “i before e except after c” thing – it is what you use to remember if it is spelled receive or recieve.

hierarchy, pier, fiery
conceive, receive, deceive, perceive


Please take a note to self that this rule does not always stand.


weight, weird, height, foreign, their, atheist, neighbor
relief, mischief, piety, believe


Well, in this post we are not concerned with the stuff that will make purists and grammar nazis lose it big time. These steps should merely help take care of most common mistakes, though remember to refrain from trying to correct everything, for your sanity sake. Always remember that as no one is perfect, no post or writing is perfect. Don’t let the technicality of proofreading destroy a good story worth telling. Proofreading concept is merely for improving a post and not to ruin it.

Happy Proofreading!
