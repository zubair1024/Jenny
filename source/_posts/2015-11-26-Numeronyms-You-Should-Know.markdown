We all love those number-based words, mostly because they sound really cool. Recently, one of my mates at my workplace failed to understand these, which got a bit embarrassing for that poor lad. Hence, I believe that not all developers out there are familiar with numeronyms, so I believe this list should give you head start:

### i18n

This is the biggest buzzword out of the lot. It stands for Internationalization. It merely refers the development of a software or an app that makes later localization possible for different target audiences around the world. It can also be considered to be the process of designing a software application so that it can potentially be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Hence, it basically revolves around making the software usable in other parts of the world.

### l10n

l10n stands for localization. It is the process by which a software or an app is adapted to a specific culture. l10n can be easily added to products that have been internationalized before.
It can entail customization related to:

Numeric, date and time formats
Use of currency
Keyboard usage
Collation and sorting
Symbols, icons and colors
Text and graphics containing references to objects, actions or ideas which, in a given culture, may be subject to misinterpretation or viewed as insensitive.
Varying legal requirements
and many more things.

### m17n

It is basically between i18n and l10n. m17n, which stands for Multilingualization, conforms to the need for the support of other writing systems that don’t only use ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) characters.

### a11y

a11y, which stands for Accessibility, is the process or standardization effort to make a software or app support people with kinds of disabilities or sensory impairments. visually impaired people who can hardly distinguish colours need high colour contrast ratio; people who cannot use a mouse need to be provided with all functionalities via keyboard; people who can’t hear need transcripts, etc. It is considered an ongoing effort since there are various issues that need to be tackled by developers.

### c14n

C14n occurs when certain data have more than one representations, and you need to convert them into a standardized format. This is a good effort for SEO (Search Engine Optimization). There are various tools in the market to give great advice about c14n, giving the needed analysis.

### i14y

It refers to the portability and compatibility of the components of a system or a product. This usually occurs when we try to have components of the web that work across various platforms and engines. Interoperable CSS is a good example of i14y approach. i14y has become a marketing buzzword in product descriptions.

### P13n

p13n, termed for Personalization, refers to the adaptation of products to the needs of different people. It is the method through which developers personalize the content for the different segments of the online audience. The reason developers turn to this is because consumers get frustrated when the content that appears have nothing to do with their interests. Personalization of ads, offers and promotions come under this category.

### v12n

A test or production server might not always be physical machine/server but instead be virtual machines hosted on a physical machine. Therefore, developers create the virtual version of an operating system, server, or other network resource and this process is refered to as v12n (Virtualization).

There are two neat numeronyms that are worth a peak which are c10k and Y2K38.
